# 🌆 City Pulse

A real-time city analytics platform that transforms weather, air quality, and event data into a single Pulse Score (0–100), helping users understand how vibrant, comfortable, and active a city feels at any moment.

Built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, Redis, FAISS, Prophet forecasting, and AI-generated city mood summaries.

## 📊 Pulse Score Algorithm

```text
Pulse Score =
  (Weather Score  × 0.50)
+ (Air Score      × 0.35)
+ (Events Score   × 0.15)

Hard cap: AQI 5 → max 45 · AQI 4 → max 65
```

Weights are tunable live via the admin dashboard without redeployment.

### Weather Score
Temperature comfort (ideal 22–28°C for India), humidity, wind speed, sky condition.

### Air Quality Score
Raw PM2.5 → EPA AQI formula → mapped to 0–100.

### Events Score
Active event count via Ticketmaster API → city activity level.

## 🔧 Key Engineering Decisions

**APScheduler inside FastAPI instead of a separate cron service**
Railway's free tier doesn't support cron jobs. Running APScheduler as a daemon thread inside the FastAPI process means the scheduler stays alive as long as the web service does — zero extra services, zero extra cost.

**FAISS for similar city search instead of SQL distance queries**
SQL threshold queries on multi-dimensional vectors don't capture proximity well. FAISS does L2 nearest-neighbour search across all city vectors in microseconds, and produces meaningfully more accurate similarity results.

**Redis instead of in-memory caching**
The original cache was a Python dict that reset on every Railway restart. Groq summaries cost API calls and take ~2 seconds each. Redis survives restarts, is shared across requests, and reduces Groq calls by ~80% in practice.

**Prophet for forecasting instead of simpler models**
Prophet handles daily seasonality in city data without manual feature engineering. It also produces 80% confidence intervals out of the box — users see uncertainty, not just a line.

**OWM geocoding before weather fetch**
OWM's city name search has ambiguity issues ("Manali" returns Tamil Nadu, not Himachal Pradesh). Using OWM's geocoding API first resolves to correct coordinates via state metadata before any weather fetch.

## 🤖 AI Mood Summaries

City Pulse uses Llama3 through the Groq API to generate natural-language descriptions of a city's current atmosphere, cached in Redis for 30 minutes.

> *"Mumbai basks in warm, crystal-clear serenity, alive and thriving tonight."*

## 🗄 Database Schema

`cities` — tracked cities with coordinates

`weather_snapshots` — weather observations every 15 min

`air_quality_snapshots` — AQI and PM2.5 measurements

`events_snapshots` — event activity data

`pulse_scores` — calculated scores and AI summaries

`neighbourhood_snapshots` — grid-level scores per city area

`city_vectors` — FAISS feature vectors for similarity search

---

## ⚙️ Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jagzgotspark/City-Pulse.git
cd City-Pulse
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key
TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Start the server:

```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

The scheduler starts automatically with the server. To run it manually against a remote DB:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_railway_url python3 -m src.scheduler
```
